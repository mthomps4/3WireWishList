A new database should be created labeled "3wirewish"
Within this database are two tables: admin-user and wishlist.

### Admin-User Table
The application uses an Admin Dashboard for all 'CRUD' like features. You may add a new username and password to this table or simply use the default 'Admin' 'Password' for local testing.

### Wishlist Table
This is where all data lies for the wish list application.

Here you will create a username, set host name to localhost, and generate a password.

These credentials will be entered into the file located in ../inc/credentials.php.
